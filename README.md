# programperspective

This is the accompanied self-lab for course cmu 15213 programmer's perspective. The lab can be downloaded at:

The data lab was quite intuitive and I did it few years ago using pen and paper, now I cannot find them and didn't want to go through the thinking process again lol. But I'll get back to it. 

The bomb lab is pretty interesting. 
Took me three nights to figure them all out.(not include the hidden phase)
solution.txt has every thought step of it for each phase and I tried to explain every thing clearly. 
defuse.txt is the actual answer, using command:
bomb defuse.txt will see all phases are defused.
